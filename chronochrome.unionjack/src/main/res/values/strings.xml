        <![CDATA[Union Jack Chronochrome™ combines time and color to create a dynamic Union Flag
         wallpaper. Chronochrome™ which is a term meaning Time-Color, was created as an experiment
         in synesthesia ― Can we become so accustomed to associating time with color that it becomes
         second nature? Instead of asking, \"What time is it?\", might we one day ask,
         \"What color is it?\"\n
